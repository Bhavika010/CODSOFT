# CODSOFT
I am grateful for Codsoft who are providing such a good internships to their students.
As i completed only 4 Task from Python Programming.
Task-1 TO-DO LIST : AS it is very helpful for us in daliy life.
Task-2 Calcultor: It is very time taking for me but also i have gain knowledge
Task-3 Password generator: As it is also interesting that how coding is also providing or suggesting a password for you of your choice. Simply you have to answers their question like how many characters do you want ? or numbers ? etc.
Task-4 Rock Paper Scissor: One of my favourite as in this i used ASCI art also and it is interesting as well as friendly.
In the time period of Internship i really enjoy this.
